# Multiclass-image-classification-using-deep-learning-in-python
#### Date:Apr23 -2025
This deep learning project to classify `6 types of wild animals` using CNN.

- **Classes:**
`1.Cheetah
2.Fox
3.Hyena
4.Lion
5.Tiger
6.Wolf`

- **Data colletion:**
Wild animals image  dataset collected from kaggle.`Image_size(224,224)` and each classes had `100 images`.

- **Features:**
Custom convolutional neural network with `5 layers(1-input,3-hidden and 1-output  layers)`,also using data augmentation to improve
generalization.

- **Trainning:**
model compile with CNN  and fit to train a model.

- **Tools:**
language Python ,
Tensorflow and keras,
Jupyter notebook.

- **Save:**
Model saved in h5(Hierarchical file)

- **Result:**
Model got at `85% accuracy` of training and `validation 65%` (Improvement need)

- **Improvements:**
Model train well but validation to be low perform ,need improvement of images size,datasets and will use earlystopping for prevent overfitting.

- **Deployment:**
Streamlit UI for user upload the  image to classification.
