# Multiclass-image-classification-using-deep-learning-in-python
This deep learning project to classify 6 types of wild animals using CNN.
Classes:
1.Cheetah
2.Fox
3.Hyena
4.Lion
5.Tiger
6.Wolf
Data colletion:
Wild animals image  dataset collected from kaggle.Image_size(224,224) and each classes had 100 images.
Features:
Custom convolutional neural network with 5 layers(1-input,3-hidden and 1-output  layers),also unsing data augmentation to improve generalization.
Tools:
language Python ,
Tensorflow and keras,
Jupyter notebook.
Save:
Model save in h5(Hierarchical file)
Result:
Model got at 85% accuracy of training and validation 65% (Improvement need)

Improvements:
Model train well but validation to be low perform ,need improvement of images size and data and earlystopping.
Deployment:
Streamlit ui for user image upload and classify.
